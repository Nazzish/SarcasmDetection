# Twitter Sarcasm Detection Using Transformers


This repository is based on the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library by HuggingFace. It is intended as a starting point for anyone who wishes to use Transformer models in text classification tasks.

## Setup

### With Conda

1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda Package Manager from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Create a new virtual environment and install packages.  
`conda create -n transformers python pandas tqdm jupyter`  
`conda activate transformers`  
If using cuda:  
  `conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch`  
else:  
  `conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch`  
`conda install -c anaconda scipy`  
`conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn`  
`pip install transformers` or download source code from [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)*
3. Clone repo.
`git clone https://github.com/muhammadadyl/SarcasmDetection.git`

*Important if you wanted to run DistilRoBERTa (soft release)

## Usage

### Twitter Sarcasm Dataset

If you are doing it manually;

Files are already available for use in `data/` folder with name `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

Once the download is complete, you can run the [data_prep_sarcasm.ipynb](data_prep_sarcasm.ipynb) notebook to get the data ready for training.

Finally, you can run the [run_model.ipynb](run_model.ipynb) notebook to fine-tune a Transformer model on the Yelp Dataset and evaluate the results.

### Current Pretrained Models

The table below shows the currently available model types and their models. You can use any of these by setting the `model_type` and `model_name` in the `args` dictionary. For more information about pretrained models, see [HuggingFace docs](https://huggingface.co/pytorch-transformers/pretrained_models.html).

| Architecture        | Model Type           | Model Name  | Details  |
| :------------- |:----------| :-------------| :-----------------------------|
| BERT      | bert | bert-base-cased | 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters.<br>Trained on cased English text. |
| XLNet      | xlnet | xlnet-base-cased | 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters. <br>XLNet English model |
| RoBERTa      | roberta | roberta-base | 125M parameters <br>RoBERTa using the BERT-base architecture |
| DistilBERT   | distilbert | distilbert-base-uncased | 6-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 66M parameters <br>DistilBERT uncased base model |
| DistilRoBERTa      | distilroberta | distilroberta-base | 6-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 82M parameters <br>DistilRoBERTa-base model. |

Note: DistilRoBERTa is in a soft release as of the day this repo published, to run this model you need to explicitly install Transformer library from Hugging Face's Repository. Installing through pip won't work here.

### Custom Datasets

When working with your own datasets, you can create a script/notebook similar to [data_prep_sarcasm.ipynb](data_prep_sarcasm.ipynb) that will convert the dataset to a Transformer ready format.

The data needs to be in `tsv` format, with four columns, and no header.

This is the required structure.

- `guid`: An ID for the row.
- `label`: The label for the row (should be an int).
- `alpha`: A column of the same letter for all rows. Not used in classification but still expected by the `DataProcessor`.
- `text`: The sentence or sequence of text.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation process in the [run_model.ipynb](run_model.ipynb) notebook outputs the confusion matrix, and the Matthews correlation coefficient. If you wish to add any more evaluation metrics, simply edit the `get_eval_reports()` function in the notebook. This function takes the predictions and the ground truth labels as parameters, therefore you can add any custom metrics calculations to the function as required.

None of this would have been possible without the hard work by the HuggingFace team in developing the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.
